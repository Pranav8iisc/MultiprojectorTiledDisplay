# MultiprojectorTiledDisplay #
Majorly, this code is an implementation of the paper "" by Brown et. al. Futher, we have [proposed]() and implemented a cross-ratio approach for enhancing the overall projection resolution by utilizing the perspective projection invariant, cross-ratio(). Code has been tested for planar projection regions, a 3X3 multiprojector setup till now. Work on GUI development and addressing arbitrary tiled configurations is under progress.
