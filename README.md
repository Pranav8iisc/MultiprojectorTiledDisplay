# MultiprojectorTiledDisplay #
Majorly, this code is an implementation of the paper multiprojector geometric alignment and edge blending approaches proposed [here](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1167859/). Futher, we have [proposed](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7019727/) and implemented an approach for enhancing the overall projection resolution by utilizing the perspective projection invariant, [cross-ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-ratio). Code has been tested for only one planar projection region configuration till now, a 3X3 multiprojector setup. Work on GUI development and addressing arbitrary tiled configurations is under progress.
